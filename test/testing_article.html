<h1>4 Classifications of Testing Software</h1>

<p>When first being introduced to the source code of
real world testing suites it can be overwhelming how many levels of abstraction
exist. The different levels of abstraction in testing suites can 
make it difficult to form an accurate mental representation of how things
really work and what the role of each peice of testing software is. Each peice of software
operates on a different level of abstraction and serves a unique
purpose. My primary goal for this article is to offer some
insight on the different levels of abstraction in testing stacks. I intend to shed some light on how these
various levels of abstraction integrate together in a testing suite.</p>

<p>There are many different levels of abstraction in testing. It can be
overwhelming to establish an accurate mental model of how real world testing
suites are architectured. To resolve this cognitive dissonance I have created 4
major classifications that nearly all testing software fits into. The
classifications I am providing are a good way to think about large testing suites in real
world applications. However,
this system of thinking is not the end all be all. As you explore
testing much deeper, you may find that there are aspects of some testing suites that
do not fall neatly into the classification schema I am providing. With that disclaimer aside,
the 4 major classifications of testing software are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Test Runners</li>
  <li>Testing Frameworks</li>
  <li>Assertion Libraries</li>
  <li>Testing Plugins</li>
</ol>

<p>Each classification essentially represents a different level of abstraction.
I am going to spend this article delving into an example implementation of each
classification. I will be demonstrating each classification by providing a
concrete example of a peice of software that falls into that given
classification. I will also demonstrate how these various pieces of software fit
together.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html">Karma</a> is an
example of a <b>test runner</b></li>
  <li><a href="http://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> is an example of a <b>testing
framework</b></li>
  <li><a href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a> is an example of an <b>assertion
library</b></li>
  <li><a href="http://sinonjs.org/">Sinon</a> is an example of a <b>testing
plugin</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Karma: Test Runner</h2>
<p>Karma is a type of test runner which creates a fake server, and then spins up tests
in various browsers using data derived from that fake server. Karma is only a test
runner, and requires a testing framework such as Mocha to plug into it in order
to actually run tests.</p>

<p>Test Runners work on the highest level of abstraction out of all testing
software. All the other testing software takes place within the test runner.
As a result, it is necessary to configure the test runner to work with the
other testing software which plug into it. In our example of using Karma as a
test runner, <code>karma init</code> is the command which creates the
<code>karma.conf.js</code> file. This file is where all our test runner
configurations will be.</p>

<p>The header of each karma configuration file follows this structure:</p>
<pre>module.exports = function(config) {
  config.set({
    basePath: '../..',
    frameworks: ['mocha']
</pre>

<p>As you can see, this configuration file offers us a hook to include our
testing framework, which exist on a lower level of abstraction than our test
runner.</p>

<p>
Additionally, Karma uses other technologies such as the <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch">minimatch library</a>, which uses regex-like syntax to
filter the correct files to use. The <code>basePath</code> property determines the
root path Karma uses to find the actual specs, which exist on a lower level of
abstraction.</p>

<h2>Mocha: Testing Framework</h2>

<p>The following file uses Mocha as a testing framework, and Chai as an assertion
library:</p>

<pre>describe('the todo.App', function() {
  context('the todo object', function(){

    it('should have all the necessary methods', function(){
      var msg = "method should exist";
      expect(todo.util.trimTodoName, msg).to.exist;
      expect(todo.util.isValidTodoName, msg).to.exist;
      expect(todo.util.getUniqueId, msg).to.exist;
    });
  });
});
</pre>

<h3>How to Distinguish Between Mocha and Chai</h3>
<p>How can we distinguish between which level of abstraction each part
of the testing suite is occurring on? In other words, we are now working on a
lower level than a test runner, we are actually writing tests now. We are using
a lot of methods which are native to JavaScript. How do we distinguish
which method is from which piece of testing software? It was easy
to differentiate between a test runner and a framework. But now we are throwing
a framework and an assertion library all in the same file. It
is becoming muddled as to which method is a result of which piece of
software. </p>

<p>We can distinguish between framework (Mocha) methods and assertion library
(Chai) methods by looking at the contents of the <code>it</code> block. 
Methods outside the <code>it</code> block are generally derived from the testing
framework. Everything within the <code>it</code> block is code coming from the assertion
library. <code>beforeEach</code>, <code>describe</code>, <code>context</code>,
<code>it</code>, are all methods extending from Mocha. <code>expect</code>, 
<code>equal</code>, and <code>exist</code>, are all methods extending from Chai. </p>

<pre>
afterEach(function() {
    $httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingExpectation();
    $httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingRequest();
    $window.localStorage.removeItem('com.shortly');
  });

  it('should have a signup method', function() {
    expect($scope.signup).to.be.a('function');
  });

</pre>

<p>All the methods concerned with the testing framework are
occurring outside the <code>it</code> block, and all methods concerned with the assertion
library are occurring inside the it block. Therefore we can conclude that
anything occurring inside the it block is indeed occurring on a lower level of
abstraction than the testing framework. Or in terms of our classification schema,
everything occurring inside the it blocks is either part of an assertion library
or a part of a testing plugin. The notion that anything inside the it block is
occurring on a lower level of abstraction than the testing framework is only a
heuristic, that is- it is merely a rule of thumb.</p>

<p><img src="./testing_article_files/1128379508_96Ame-S.png"></p>

<p>There are many technologies
out there and unlimited edge cases to predict, but as a generality it would be
fair to view the it block as the interface between two different levels of
abstraction in testing.</p>

<h2>Chai: Assertion Library</h2>
<p>Chai is an assertion library that plugs into Mocha. Up until now we have just
been concerned with using a test runner for automation, and using a testing
framework for setup, teardown, and structure. But now we are getting into the meat
and potatoes. The assertion library is what actually runs the specs and
determines whether any given condition is valid or not. Ultimately, every test
is ran by methods which are derived from our assertion library.
It is worth mentioning though, not every framework needs
an external assertion library. <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> for example, has it's own assertion
library builtin. Mocha is just structured in such a way where it <b>does</b>
need an external assertion library.
This makes Mocha more difficult to setup initially, but offers much greater
flexibility than frameworks which use a builtin assertion library such as
Jasmine.</p>

<h2>Sinon: Testing Plugin</h2>
<p>Sinon is a plugin which hooks into Chai and gives us the ability to perform a
more diverse set of tests. Through the Sinon plugin we can create mocks,
stubs, and fake servers:</p>

<pre>describe('API integration', function(){
  var server, setupStub, JSONresponse;

  beforeEach(function() {
    setupStub = sinon.stub(todo, 'setup');
    server = sinon.fakeServer.create();
  });

  it('todo.setup receives an array of todos when todo.init is called', function () {
  });

  afterEach(function() {
    server.restore();
    setupStub.restore();
  });
});
</pre>

<p>Sinon has a bunch of cool features that allow you to really get into the
nooks and crannies of your source code and see what is really going on under the
hood.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this article helped you by providing a good mental model in which to
view large scale testing suites. Of course no heuristic is a substitute for playing with it on
you're own and getting a feel for it. Once you start writing specs using all these
different software components you will get an intuition of how they all fit
together. As we are exposed to different systems, over time we become
more adept at noticing underlying patterns which determine how those
systems operate. My purpose for writing this article was to uncover some 
underlying design patterns in testing systems. Hopefully this article will make
you more cognizant of some of these underlying patterns.
Pattern recognition is only the first step though, after pattern
recognition you need to move onto pattern utilization, and not long after that
you will by default move into the ultimate stage of engineering: pattern
creation. I hope you found this article interesting and insightful. Have a good one!</p>
